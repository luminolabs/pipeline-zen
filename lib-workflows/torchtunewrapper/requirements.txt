# Framework for LLM fine-tuning
#
# If you're on a mac and you're having trouble installing this, try building `torchao` from source.
# `torchao` is a dependency of `torchtune` and it's not available for mac on PyPI.
# You need to install both the stable and nightly versions of `torchao` to get `torchtune` to work.
#
# ```bash
# git clone https://github.com/pytorch/ao
# cd ao
# git checkout v0.3.1-rc1
# pip install --pre --upgrade torchao --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cpu
# TORCHAO_NIGHTLY=1 python setup.py install
# pip install "torchtune==0.5.0"
# ```
#
# NOTE: Always list torchtune last in the requirements file,
# because installation fails on OSX and needs special handling.
# So, we want everything else to be installed first, and let torchtune be the last one,
# so that we can handle it separately.
